// Avoiding side effects and functional purity - eg Side Effects: avoiding changing
// the already defined variable from a function, Functional purity - always want to return a value.
// this creates something called  "deterministic" no matter the input in the parametes, it 
// always returns a value

//What are the two elements of a pure function?
//1. Deterministic --> always produces the same results given the same inputs
//2. No Side Effects -->  It does not depend on any state, 
// or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input elements.
